# Dynamic Module Completion Tracker

The **Dynamic Module Completion Tracker** is a JavaScript application designed to enhance user experience on a web page where users can mark modules as complete or incomplete. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to dynamically update the UI based on user interactions and their membership status.

## Features

### 1. Dynamic Button and UI Updates

- When a user clicks on a specific button, it toggles between marking a module as complete or incomplete.
- Upon clicking, the button's appearance and text change to reflect the updated status.
- The associated UI elements are updated accordingly, showing or hiding additional content as needed.

### 2. Member Data Integration

- The application integrates with Memberstack, a service that manages membership-related data for users.
- The application utilizes the Memberstack DOM object to retrieve and update the user's JSON data.
- Modules are marked as complete or incomplete in the user's JSON data based on their interactions.

### 3. Event Handling and Delegation

- Event listeners are used to capture user interactions, such as button clicks.
- Event delegation is implemented to efficiently handle these interactions, improving performance and reducing code duplication.

### 4. Error Handling and Logging

- The application incorporates error handling to gracefully manage potential issues, providing a better user experience.
- Logging is utilized to track the completion status of modules and other relevant information for debugging purposes.
