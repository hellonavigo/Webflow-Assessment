# JavaScript Code Explanation

The JavaScript code in the HTML document is responsible for two main tasks: updating text descriptions based on attribute scores and handling sorting options.

## Updating Attribute Text

The JavaScript code defines a function named `updateText`. This function is crucial as it changes the text description of an attribute based on its score.

1. **Fetching Attribute Score:** The score of an attribute card is extracted from the HTML.
2. **Score-Dependent Text Update:** Depending on the attribute's score value, the function dynamically updates the text. The possible descriptions include:
   - "High": When the score is between 6.0 and 7.0.
   - "Upper Medium": When the score is between 5.0 and 5.9.
   - "Lower Medium": When the score is between 4.0 and 4.9.
   - "Low": When the score is between 1.0 and 3.9.
   - "Unknown": As a fallback for any other score value. 

## Initial Text Update

When the webpage loads (DOMContentLoaded event), the JavaScript code performs an initial text update for the attribute cards:

1. **Locating Attribute Cards:** The code identifies all the attribute cards present on the page.
2. **Extracting and Updating:** For each attribute card, the code retrieves its score and uses the `updateText` function to set the appropriate description.

## Sorting and Text Update

The code also manages sorting and updating text descriptions when sorting preferences change:

1. **Listening for Dropdown Changes:** The code listens for changes in the sorting dropdown.
2. **Sorting Process:** When a user changes the dropdown, a sorting mechanism (not detailed in this snippet) sorts the attribute cards accordingly.
3. **Updating Descriptions:** After the sorting process, the code iterates through the sorted cards. It extracts each card's score and employs the `updateText` function to set the updated description based on the new order.

**Note:** This explanation mainly focuses on the core JavaScript functionality that involves dynamically altering attribute descriptions based on scores and sorting options. The overall code includes various other components like external scripts for libraries and fonts, HTML structure, and additional styling. However, the core functionality revolves around the dynamic modification of attribute descriptions.
