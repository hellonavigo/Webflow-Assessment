JavaScript Code Explanation

The JavaScript code in the HTML document is responsible for updating text descriptions based on attribute scores and handling sorting options.

Updating Attribute Text

The JavaScript code defines a function named updateText. This function changes the text description of an attribute based on its score.
The score of an attribute card is fetched from the HTML.
Depending on the score value, the function updates the text to "High," "Upper Medium," "Lower Medium," "Low," or "Unknown." These descriptions indicate the attribute's performance level.
Initial Text Update

When the webpage loads (DOMContentLoaded event), the code finds all the attribute cards on the page.
For each card, it extracts the score and uses the updateText function to set the appropriate description.
Sorting and Text Update

The code listens for changes in the sorting dropdown.
When the dropdown changes, the sorting code (which is not included in the provided snippet) sorts the attribute cards.
After sorting, the code updates the text descriptions for each card using the updateText function.
Note: This explanation focuses on the core JavaScript functionality related to updating text descriptions based on attribute scores and sorting options. The code also includes some other elements, like external scripts for libraries and fonts, HTML structure, and additional styling, but the core functionality centers around dynamically changing attribute descriptions.
