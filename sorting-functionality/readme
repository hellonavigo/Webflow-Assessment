# Webflow Testing Page Readme

This readme provides an overview of the provided HTML code that implements a testing page on the Webflow platform. The code snippet aims to create a sortable card-based interface displaying attributes and their corresponding scores.

## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to showcase a dynamic dashboard-style interface using HTML and JavaScript, allowing users to sort attribute cards based on their scores in either ascending or descending order.

## Usage

1. **Page Structure**: The code consists of an HTML document with various elements and CSS classes for styling and functionality.

2. **Sorting Dropdown**: At the top of the page, there is a dropdown menu with two sorting options:
   - "High to Low": Sorts the attribute cards based on scores in descending order.
   - "Low to High": Sorts the attribute cards based on scores in ascending order.

3. **Attribute Cards**: Below the dropdown, there is a list of attribute cards. Each card displays the name of an attribute, its score, and a text-based result indicating whether the score is above or below average. Additionally, an icon is displayed on the left side of each card.

4. **Card Sorting**: The attribute cards are dynamically sorted based on the selected sorting option from the dropdown menu. Initially, the default sorting order is "High to Low."

## How to Use

1. **Accessing the Page**: To use this code, you need to have a Webflow project and a testing page where you can paste the provided HTML code.

2. **Inserting the Code**: Open your Webflow project and navigate to the testing page where you want to implement this code. Replace the existing code on the page with the provided HTML code.

3. **Customization (Optional)**: You can customize the content of the attribute cards, including attribute names, scores, and result texts. You can also modify the URLs of the icons if needed.

4. **Preview and Interact**: After inserting the code, preview the page to see the attribute cards and the sorting functionality in action. Test the sorting feature by selecting different sorting options from the dropdown.

## Notes

- The code utilizes external stylesheets and JavaScript libraries to achieve its functionality. Ensure that these resources are accessible and correctly linked for the code to work as intended.
- The code includes inline JavaScript for sorting the attribute cards based on scores. Make sure not to remove or modify this script unless you have a good understanding of its functionality.

## Attribution

- The code includes resources and scripts from Webflow and other external sources. Make sure to respect their terms of use and attribution requirements.
