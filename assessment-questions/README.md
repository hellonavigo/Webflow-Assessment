# Multi-Step Form with Validation

This code implements a multi-step form with validation for each step. The form is split into multiple sections, each representing a step, and the user can navigate through these steps using "Next" and "Previous" buttons. The code is written in JavaScript and utilizes both vanilla JavaScript and the jQuery library.

## Features

### JavaScript

#### `window.onload` Event Handler

The JavaScript code within the first `<script>` tag is executed when the window finishes loading. It defines a function `enableNextButtonForStep` responsible for enabling/disabling the "Next" button based on the completion status of required fields in each step. The script binds event listeners to the required input fields and "Next" button. It also handles the display of a tooltip alert if the user tries to proceed without completing the required fields.

#### `$(document).ready()` Event Handler

The JavaScript code within the second `<script>` tag uses jQuery's `$(document).ready()` function, which runs when the DOM is fully loaded. It sets up the behavior of the "Next" and "Previous" buttons for each step.

- `showStep()`: This function shows the current step and hides the others.

- `validateStep(step)`: This function validates the inputs of the given step. For radio inputs, it ensures at least one option is selected. For other inputs, it checks if required fields are filled. If validation fails, it displays error messages.

- `init()`: This function initializes the form behavior. It sets up event listeners for "Next" and "Previous" buttons, handles input validation, and manages the display of tooltips.

- `scrollToTop()`: This function scrolls the page to the top when called, providing a smooth scrolling effect.

## Usage

1. Load the HTML structure for the form, including the individual step divisions (`.step_1`, `.step_2`, etc.).
2. Include the jQuery library and the provided JavaScript code inside `<script>` tags within your HTML document. Ensure the jQuery library is loaded before the second script block.
3. For each step, add required input fields and buttons with appropriate class names (e.g., `.button_next`, `.button_previous`).
4. Customize the validation messages and styles to match your design and requirements.

## Notes

- The code assumes the form's structure and class names match the selectors used in the JavaScript. Modify the code if your HTML structure differs.
- This code provides a basic example of a multi-step form. Depending on your project's complexity, you might need to extend or modify the code to meet your specific requirements.
