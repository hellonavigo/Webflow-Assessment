# Code Functionality Readme

This JavaScript code is designed to execute when the DOM content of a webpage has finished loading. Its primary purpose is to handle user authentication and redirection based on certain conditions stored in the local storage of the browser. The code performs the following tasks:

## 1. DOM Content Loaded Event Listener

The code listens for the "DOMContentLoaded" event, which indicates that the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed by the browser.

## 2. Parsing Member Data from Local Storage

The code attempts to retrieve member data stored in the local storage under the key "_ms-mem". It then parses this data as JSON, and if no data is found, it defaults to an empty object.

## 3. User Authentication Check

The code checks if the parsed member data contains an "id" property, which indicates that the user is logged in.

- If the user is logged in:
  - It proceeds to retrieve custom fields from the member data.
  - It checks if a specific custom field with the key "tf-poc-1as-url" exists.

## 4. Redirection Handling

- If the custom field "tf-poc-1as-url" exists:
  - It extracts the URL stored within the custom field.
  - It checks if the URL is empty or contains only whitespace characters.
  - If the URL is empty:
    - It logs a message indicating the emptiness of the URL.
    - It schedules a retry after 10 seconds to get an updated URL from the custom field.
    - If the second attempt is still unsuccessful, it redirects the user to the root ("/") URL.
  - If the URL is not empty, it proceeds to a function called "redirectToUrl" for redirection.
- If the custom field "tf-poc-1as-url" does not exist, it redirects the user to the root ("/") URL.

## 5. Redirecting to URL

- The "redirectToUrl" function is responsible for finalizing the redirection.
- It checks if the provided URL has a protocol ("http://" or "https://"). If not, it adds "https://" as the protocol.
- After 20 seconds, it triggers a redirection to the modified URL.

## 6. Logging Information

Throughout the process, the code logs various messages to the console, indicating different stages of execution, such as DOM content loading, user authentication, existence of custom fields, and redirection events.

The primary use case for this code seems to be within a web application that manages user sessions and custom data fields. The code aims to ensure that a logged-in user is redirected to a specific URL stored in their custom data after a potential retry mechanism to handle empty URLs. If the user is not logged in or the custom field does not exist, the code redirects them to the root URL of the application.

Please note that the code assumes that the browser environment supports the necessary features like local storage and DOM manipulation.
